###Svelte
Practiced building a smooth, animated image trail using SvelteKit, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS. Absolutely loved how it turned out—this kind of satisfying, interactive UI work is exactly the type of creative front-end development I enjoy most.

From mouse-tracking to staggered animations and image cycling, it was a fun challenge and a rewarding result.
